Polyglot Server

- jimboca: Make setup doesn't have a rule in the makefile
	   	   sudo pip install tornado 
           Doesn't work with python2: python -m polyglot -v
	   Instead:  python polyglot/__main__.py  -v
	   
This is the source code for the Polyglot server that will allow the ISY 
controller to communicate with third party devices.

To download development dependencies, run:
    sudo make setup

When running for development, create /etc/polyglot and give the dev user 
permission for read + write.

To run the pure Python version for development, type:
    python -m polyglot -v

To compile the C code version of this application, use make.
    make build
The C code version will be placed in the build directory. The compiled
version may be run with the same python command from the build directory.
    python -m polyglot -v

To install the C code version of this application, again, use make. This will
also take care of the aforementioned dependencies.
    make build
    sudo make install

This installs polyglot globally and creates a user called polyglot that may run
the application. Other users are not permitted to access the config directory.
This is done for basic security reasons as passwords will likely be sored 
there. To run the application as the polyglot user:
    sudo su polyglot
    polyglot
To run the application as the current user:
    polyglot -c CONFIG_DIR
Where CONFIG_DIR is a full path to a custom created config directory to which
the current user has read + write permissions.

In the future, su access to polyglot will be disabled and an init script will
be created to run the server.

[todo] Test make install
[todo] Test running installed version
[todo] Create init script
[todo] Disable su to polyglot user
